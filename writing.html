          <p>“You’ll be back,” joked my friend, the president of a local nanobrewery, tipping back his glass. “Five to ten years, when you’ve got kids and you want to settle down.” He’s the sixth person to utter those words since I broke the news that I’d be leaving my hometown of Buffalo, New York, to move to Madison, Wisconsin. He also knows full well that “settling down” is the last thing on my agenda––and the funny thing is, I don’t think it’s on his, either. He owns one of the city’s truly exciting startups, and he leads a team that’s putting Buffalo on the national map in craft beer. But that doesn’t matter right now. Buffalonians are a little too accustomed to saying good-bye, and I’ve just been refiled under “deserter.”

          <p>On Thursday Texas Governor Rick Perry expressed his determination to pass Senate Bill 5, the Texas bill that would effectively shut down all but a handful of abortion clinics in the state––and he has advice for Senator Wendy Davis, who bravely filibustered the bill on Tuesday.

<p>Telling the National Right to Life convention that “it&#39;s important to remember while we are under an obligation to protect the health and safety of people who live here, we are under no obligation to make things easier for the abortionist,&quot; Perry demonstrated his concern for women’s health and safety by admonishing Davis, who was raised by a single mother and put herself through Harvard Law despite having had a child at 19.</p>

          <p>When I used to tell people I wanted to be a writer, the immediate response from older writers was invariably, “Lots of people think they want to be writers. If you could be happy doing anything else—anything at all—do that instead.” If, instead of just waving off harsh words, wannabes could spend a day, week, or month in the trenches—reading rejection after cold rejection, organizing millions of receipts to amass tax write-offs, searching endlessly for affordable health insurance—the profession wouldn’t seem quite so glamorous. And if being a wordsmith isn’t for the faint of heart, being a chef is only for the toughest of the tough: constant pressure, excruciating hours in a hot kitchen, and a work schedule that precludes any sort of normal social life, all to feed strangers who may or may not understand what you’re trying to do.

          <p>When Robert Kiersz, a thirty-year member of the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus, is asked about former Music Director Doreen Rao, he doesn’t hesitate to express his admiration. “Doreen is extraordinary,” he says. “The talent she brings, the knowledge, the background, and just her personality––she’s so giving, such an excellent teacher.”
It’s high praise for the woman who was terminated from her post as music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Chorus on January 18—without, the chorus says, any explanation from the board of directors.
