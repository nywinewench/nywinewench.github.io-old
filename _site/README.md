# Stellenbauchery

This is the Jekyll source code for [Stellenbauchery](http://stellenbauchery.com),
the website of Julia Burke.

## Thanks

This site wouldn't be possible without the awesome contributors to Jekyll,
since I would rather shoot myself than work within the confines of a crappy
CMS and really didn't feel like maintaining a Sinatra/Rails app for a simple
blog.
