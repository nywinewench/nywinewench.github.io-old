    <p>This weekend I was determined to go wine tasting – being
surrounded by incredible wine farms the past two weeks and only visiting two of them due to a lack of transportation has had me feeling like a eunuch at the Playboy mansion, so I made it my mission to find a tasting buddy with a good nose and a good set of wheels. I found both in Dana, my buddy who works in the
Blaauwklippen vineyard, and we took off on Saturday with nothing but wine in our plans.</p>

<p>Our first stop was <a href="http://www.delheim.com/">Delheim</a>, and the drive-up alone was absolutely amazing. The road was lined with flowering trees and winded up a mountainside, with pines in one direction and vineyards in another. The wine centre had a log cabin vibe, and we were served at a table for two rather than
at the counter, giving us time to linger over and discuss each wine. Three dessert wines on the list immediately jumped out at me: a Noble Late Harvest riesling, a semi-sweet gewürztraminer, and a riesling/chenin blanc semi-sweet blend. I was intrigued to find the sort of wines we make up in cool New York State, and impressed to find them delicious and complex. Though I like a little more acidity in my dessert wines, the gewürztraminer was particularly tasty; the description mentioned Turkish Delight on the nose, which I found delightful and accurate.</p>

<p>Our next stop was <a href="http://www.tokara.co.za/">Tokara</a>. I realized at that point I should just stop thinking to myself “THIS is the most beautiful view I’ve ever seen,” since it seems every place I go is more gorgeous than the last. Tokara’s vineyards run steeply down the side of a mountain which can be seen from the
giant window of its classy, modern tasting room. The standout here was a wooded chenin blanc, absolutely luscious with toasty buttered almonds and tropical fruit flavors and the sexiest mouthfeel I’ve experienced here so far – while most of the whites I’ve tried here so far have been crisp and refreshing, this was the first that I would actually want to spend an evening with. I bought a bottle for about R50, a steal at around US$5.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.zorgvlietwines.com/">Zorgvliet</a>, located in the Banhoek Valley near Stellenbosch,came highly recommended to us, and the wines exceeded our high expectations. A fascinating menu offered several single cultivars we hadn’t seen before
including petit verdot, pinot noir (unfortunately sold out!), tannat, and that grape that is closest to my heart: cabernet franc. I went straight for the franc and with one sniff I felt like I was home in New York: the nose was poblano, peppercorns, and pencil shavings, the palate was sumptuous and fleshy,
and the finish was spunky tannins and awesome length. I could’ve spent the whole afternoon getting franc’d but forced myself to move on to the malbec, tannat and petit verdot. The last was most impressive, an intense,concentrated, no-messing-around red that begged for steak. Zorgvliet’s winemaker has a gentle hand with oak and an obvious affinity for single cultivar reds. I bought a bottle of franc and made up my mind to visit again.</p>

<p>One winery, <a href="http://www.thelema.co.za/">Thelema</a>, was about to close when we showed up, but I immediately thought of my friend Andrea when we drove past the vineyards and saw roses planted at the end of each row. Andrea, a botanist at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, had asked me if I had seen this
practice. As I understand it, if there are certain diseases present in the vineyard, it will show up on the roses first and give the viticulturist a heads-up that something is wrong. This is the first time I’ve seen it in South Africa but Dana informed me that it’s fairly common. There you go, Andrea!</p>

<p>We finished our day of wine tasting at <a href="http://www.delaire.co.za/">Delaire</a>, a nationally renowned wine farm whose sauvignon blanc was recently awarded Best Sauvignon Blanc in South Africa. We were too late for tasting but were encouraged to have a glass of wine while enjoying the high mountain view from the wine centre patio. We couldn’t pass up a chance to try to famous sauv blanc. Indeed, it was snappy and zesty with nice grapefruit and gooseberry on the finish, but the nose had just a hint of that withered-spinach-leaves scent that I’m not crazy
about in sauv blanc. Though it was certainly a pleasurable wine and perfect for the circumstance, the best sauv blanc I’ve tried in South Africa thus far is still Slaley’s more complex and clean version.</p>

<p>After all this wine it was time to eat, so we grabbed a
pizza at a café in Stellenbosch that actually had two chickens running around under the tables. I knew I had only scratched the surface of the Stellenbosch wine scene, but if today was any indication, I’m in for more world-class wine than I’ve ever had in my life. </p>
