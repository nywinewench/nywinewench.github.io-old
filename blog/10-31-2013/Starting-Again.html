    <p>I cried only once for my hometown of Buffalo, New York, when I left this summer to start the next chapter of my life in Madison, Wisconsin. </p>

<p>I had spent the day in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niagara_Escarpment_AVA">Niagara County</a>, spending time with friends and enjoying the exciting wines being made in the region where I had my first wine tasting, my first wine job, and my <a href="http://lennthompson.typepad.com/lenndevours/2009/11/bees-bbrite-brix-and-beer-what-i-learned-from-my-first-harvest.html">first harvest</a>. I came home and bottled my 2012 malbec, made from grapes grown at <a href="http://www.arrowheadspringvineyards.com/">Arrowhead Spring Vineyards</a>. And when I was finished, I cleaned up the mess (I&#39;ve been called &quot;the messiest winemaker&quot; for my inability to bottle wine without looking like I&#39;m butchering a cow), sat down on the porch, and cried. I felt as though the wine part of my life was ending. </p>

<p>Over the two years since I worked in the wine industry full-time, I had tried to keep feeding my wine passion despite office jobs, marathon training, personal struggles, and living 45 minutes from wine country. Now, I was moving to another state entirely––and surely there was no wine industry in Wisconsin (though I was more than a little excited for the beer). Was it time to say goodbye to one of my greatest loves in life?</p>

<p>I might&#39;ve made a less dramatic scene on that summer night if I had known that not a month into my new life in Madison, I&#39;d find myself in the middle of a vineyard with a cluster of grapes in my hand. </p>

<p>It all started with a post from <a href="http://www.madisondistillery.com/Homepage.html">Old Sugar Distillery&#39;s</a> Facebook page asking for volunteers to help pick grapes for their brandy and grappa. I think I was the first person to call the number, which got me Dave Mitchell, owner of <a href="http://www.mitchell-vineyard.com/">Mitchell Vineyard</a> in Oregon, Wisconsin––which, I learned, was just 12 miles south of Madison. I could get there by bike.</p>

<p>A few nights later, I was cleaning my clippers and packing a peanut-butter-and-honey sandwich. I woke up bright and early and rode for an hour and a half, the country roads kicking my butt the whole way (Okay, Midwest, I&#39;m sorry I called you flat. <strong>Point made.</strong>), and ended up here.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/mitchell_sign.jpg" alt="mitchellsign" title="Mitchell Vineyards sign in front of vineyard"></p>

<p>Mitchell Vineyard is the gorgeous, six-acre property of Dave Mitchell, who planted the first vines in 1976. &quot;I swear, he knows every single vine. He talks to them,&quot; Mary, his awesome partner, told me once with a smile. Dave is the kind of vineyard owner who sends his team beauty shots of individual vines at 10 pm on a weeknight long after harvest is over. In other words, he&#39;s my kind of person.</p>

<p>After ten minutes in the vineyard I never wanted to leave. I asked Dave the next day if he needed help for the rest of harvest, and before I knew it, I was a Mitchell Vineyard employee. And the next phase of my wine life had begun.</p>
