    <p>Now that South Africa&#39;s 2014 harvest is over and the new wines are aging away in their barrels and tanks, I asked friends from a couple of my favorite wineries to report on the vintage. <a href="http://www.muratie.co.za/">Muratie</a> is a tremendous farm in the Simonsberg region of Stellenbosch that I had <a href="http://stellenbauchery.com/blog/03-05-2011/starting-off-with-a-bang.html">the pleasure of visiting</a> in both 2010 and 2011. Director Rijk Melck, who was kind enough to show me around me on my second visit, took some time to chat with me about vintage 2014.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/muratieharvest.jpg" alt="Muratie harvest shot" title="Wine coming from tank at Muratie; image courtesy of Muratie"></p>

<p>Muratie&#39;s harvest began the second week of January and ended just 2 and a half weeks ago––they&#39;ll be pressing their last two tanks as you read this. &quot;Longest harvest ever for us!&quot; Rijk tells me. &quot;We were blessed by not having the usual East Wind that comes around in October. This had a major effect/bonus for a perfect flowering time and fruit set. I also think our winter chill units last year were perfect,&quot; he says. </p>

<p>Stellenbosch certainly had an easier winter than we did here in the US. As a result, Rijk reports, &quot;All our block performed exceptionally well, but there were two cabernet sauvignon and one shiraz block that stood a head above the rest.&quot; </p>

<p>I have enjoyed Muratie&#39;s cabernet very much in the past. When I last visited Muratie was considering discontinuing its single-varietal merlot and planning to put that fruit toward their red blend; Rijk says they ultimately decided to continue with merlot but &quot;make it a little softer and at a different price point&quot; from their iconic red blend, Ansela van de Caab. &quot;Ansela remains our premium wine,&quot; he explains. &quot;The merlot fruit for this comes from site specific blocks on the Estate and made with more extraction.&quot; </p>

<p>Rijk adds that they are continuing to pursue a more complex shiraz––no small feat considering their shiraz bottlings have been amazing in the past––and planting a small patch of mourvedre and grenache in the vineyard. Perhaps we can expect a blockbuster Rhone blend? I certainly hope so.</p>

<p>Asked what&#39;s new and exciting in the cellar, Rijk tells me they are experimenting with natural yeast and post-fermentation maceration. I&#39;ve never attempted the latter, but it&#39;s basically leaving the fermented wine on skins rather than pressing the juice out as soon as primary fermentation is complete. <a href="http://winemakermag.com/677-the-phenol-phenomenon">Winemaker Magazine</a> tells me this technique can improve color stability, and some winemakers prefer it to the cold soak (a practice I&#39;ve used) because it softens the tannins. </p>

<p>Finally, Rijk is excited about this year&#39;s Laurens Campher blended white, one of their wild-ferment wines, which includes 25 percent verdehlo––a grape I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve seen in SA white blends. They get the verdehlo from a neighboring farmer. </p>
