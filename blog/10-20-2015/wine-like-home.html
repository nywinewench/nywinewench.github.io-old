    <p>I get to taste a lot of wine in my new job. That&#39;s sort of the point––it&#39;s why I wanted this particular gig, to have the kind of palate that you only get from constant tasting of wines from all over the world––and it&#39;s what I have to do to be worth a damn at it. Sometimes, in addition to finding good wines for our customers, I find a good wine for me. This is one of those.</p>

<p><img src="/photos/gordo.jpg" alt="Gordo Monastrell" title="Gordo monastrell"></p>

<p>I was told once that if I were a grape I&#39;d be Monastrell because it flourishes most outside its home. At the time, that made me sad, but I didn&#39;t question it; I felt like I&#39;d always be on the road. Now here I am, on my ninth move in ten years, and I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve found a place I can stay awhile. I love my job and this great new city and my friends here, and my loved ones aren&#39;t too far away. I&#39;d like to stay, and that&#39;s the most I can ever say.</p>

<p>Tasting this wine at work reminded me why I fell in love with Monastrell all those years ago. The dried black fruit, the leathery feel on the palate, the tangy pepper, the hint of graphite––it&#39;s all there. This one has more of the mineral as it opens, with maybe a little floral thing behind it; there&#39;s thirty percent cab in there too. This is the kind of wine I want to last forever, not because I&#39;m watching it change or because it&#39;s terribly cerebral but because it feels like the right soundtrack for me, and it just always has. </p>

<p>Maybe it&#39;s fitting that I&#39;ve never even been to Spain, the home of this grape. I&#39;d have to disagree on the point that we&#39;re so alike, though––I may not have stayed local, but Monastrell in its native Spain, and particularly this one, is as good as I&#39;ve ever had it.</p>

<p>The winemaker, Patrick Mata, named the wine after his dad José. He&#39;s the fourth in a family line of winemakers in Yecla (they make this wine through the cooperative Compania de Vinos del Atlantico). I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to be born into a family business, to know that your livelihood will take place in the same dirt that your parents&#39; and grandparents&#39; did. My life has been pretty much the opposite, and it&#39;s kind of amazing to taste something that someone made with the legacy of their whole family in mind. </p>
