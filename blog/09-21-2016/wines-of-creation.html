  <div class='large_column bottom_border'>
    <p>Last week I had the immense pleasure of joining the <a href="http://www.bluecraneimports.com">Blue Crane Imports</a> gang for dinner with Jean-Claude Martin, winemaker at <a href="http://www.creationwines.com">Creation Wines</a> in Walker Bay. </p>

<p><img src="/photos/creation.jpg" alt="Creation Viognier" title="Creation Viognier"></p>

<p>Martin and his wife Carolyn Martin own the winery together. I tasted a few wonderful Creation wines while I was in South Africa, but never the full range; we&#39;re working with the excellent sauvignon blanc/sémillon in the shop right now and its mineral notes and little kick of poblano are a huge hit with my sauv drinkers. Walker Bay is one of my favorite South African regions for hauntingly complex white wines, and that was before I tasted Jean-Claude Martin&#39;s viognier.</p>

<p>Viognier and I have a rough history. I almost never choose single-varietal viognier for my own consumption; it&#39;s a tricky grape that doesn&#39;t reach its full flavor intensity (which, even at its best, is the super-floral potpourri aromatic thing that just isn&#39;t what I look for in a white wine for my own use) until about 14% ABV a lot of the time, at which point it&#39;s usually missing the acidity I crave. With <a href="http://illahevineyards.squarespace.com/vineyard/">maybe one exception</a>, I&#39;ve never had one I really loved.</p>

<p>But I really loved Creation&#39;s. Its mineral intensity and delicate structure made the aromatics seem welcome, not heavy-handed, with a finish that just goes on and on for days. Like many of my favorite South African winemakers and winery owners, Martin is very old-world in his thinking (he&#39;s from Switzerland), and it shows in the elegance and restraint his wines display. &quot;Our competition is the old world,&quot; he told us at dinner at <a href="http://www.tausauthentic.com">Taus Authentic</a>, where his wines married happily with oysters, charcuterie, and duck breast. &quot;When you look at Burgundy, they haven&#39;t jumped on fashion trends; they stick to the place and that&#39;s what we try to do at the end of the day.&quot;</p>

<p>Creation Chardonnay is also pretty incredible, with the same fierce acidity that runs through all the wines complementing a lush surge of tropical fruit and maybe a little green gooseberry. It&#39;s fermented in oak that yields a subtle vanilla note, not at all heavy. On acidity, a hallmark of his wines along with that Walker Bay minerality, Martin says, &quot;To add tartaric is a marriage that can never work.&quot; And with his terroir, it seems wholly unnecessary. </p>

<p>We also tasted through merlot, syrah/grenache, and pinot noir; while they were all delicious, the merlot really stole my heart, as South African merlot tends to do. Chocolate, berries, pepper, maybe a touch of eucalyptus? Delightful, especially with my impeccably prepared duck breast. </p>

<p>I&#39;m quite lucky to have had the chance to experience these wines in the perfect environment: with excellent food and Jean-Claude Martin&#39;s thoughtful analysis. But they shine in a variety of settings, and I encourage anyone who, like me, has fallen in love with cool South Africa to seek them out.</p>
